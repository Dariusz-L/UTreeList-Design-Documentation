*This section has a form similar to an essay, consisting of loosely structured thoughts which serves as a preliminary summary. The rest of the documentation is going to be organized in as granular way as it possibly makes sense, so you can find anything easily. All of the subsequent pages are a detailed description of information presented here, so you can move on any time if you're looking for something specific.*

The project described in this documentation is a graphical user interface library for Unity3D engine. It is supposed to consist of various, reusable graphical lists and list elements for hierarchical and interconnected data manipulation, organization and presentation. 

There are several purposes for this project to be created, all of them will be described in detail later. The same goes for the documentation itself.

However, main guilty here is another application developed. Its identified features so far share a large extent of functionality, so to reduce an unneccesarily repeated work it seems the best to have a reusable and easily extentable common basis, which display a portion of essential qualities. This is why the documenting all of them and tracking is critical.

There were already few attempts of implementing the application in a frivolous way, even if some of qualities where taken into account it still was too little for a long and well development progress.

The lack of understanding of impact caused by some qualities required initially led to over engineering in some places making implementing simple use cases a great challenge. On the other hand the lack of well defined functionalities and qualities with their importance, priority led to inability for effective progress.

Functionalities derives from a business need - big picture and small picture. Since I'm going to use a scrum terminology it could be defines as epics and user stories.
Qualities on the other hand are much larger beast, big inspiration here is [ISO/IIEC 25010 Quality Model](https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010), however for purpose of this project and pragmatic approach it is going be modified.
