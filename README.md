This documentation is meant to provide a description of the [UTreeList project](https://github.com/Dariusz-L/UTreeList) design processes and architecture decisions.  
In other words - to take a simple-phrased idea and expand it into a real life software feature in an organized and well understood way.

### Existing Design Processes
The processes and documentation styles in this documentation are mainly inspired by following:
- [TutorialsPoint - Software Engineering Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_engineering/index.htm)
- [arc42](https://arc42.org/)
